# Google Search Front-End
This project is a simple implementation of a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. It allows users to perform searches, just like they would on Google's own website. The project is designed as a learning exercise to explore HTML, CSS, and web form interactions.

# Background

In this project, we create HTML forms to send search queries to Google's web servers by emulating Google's URL structure with query strings. We learn how to create forms, add input fields, and submit data to an existing web server.

# Specifications

    - The website consists of three pages: Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.
    - Google Search page features a search bar and "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.
    - Google Image Search page allows users to search for images.
    - Google Advanced Search page provides options for detailed search queries.
    - Links in the upper-right corner of each page facilitate navigation between the three pages.
    - The CSS styles resemble Google's own aesthetics for a consistent look and feel.
  
  # Hints

    - Experiment with Google searches to determine the parameter names and structure in Google's URLs.
    - Use <input> elements with name and value attributes for GET parameters.
    - Use hidden input fields for parameters that users should not see or modify.
